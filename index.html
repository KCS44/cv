            <p><em>Shift Manager <strong>PZ Cussons East Africa</strong></em></p>
            <p>I completed my bachelors in Mechanical Engineering at the <a href="http://tukenya.ac.ke/"target="_blank">Technical University of Kenya</a> and I am currently in the management trainee program at <a href="https://www.pzcussons.com/">PZ Cussons East Africa</a>. <br>
                My role currently at a PZ Cussons is shift management. In this role, I manage shifts with the goal of achieving production targets. This includes material planning, production planning, resource allocation and managing the maintenance team to tackle breakdowns during the shift. The greatest achievement while working at PZ Cussons has been doubling the production capacity of the dish washing paste production line to 10 tonnes by reducing batch cycle times and improving batch sizes.
                <br> Previously, I worked at <a href="https://www.tatachemicals.com/operations/magadi"target="_blank">Tata Chemicals Magadi</a> as a mechanical inspector. In this role I was tasked with conducting condition monitoring on fans, gearboxes, motors, pumps and centrifuges through vibration analysis. Later on, I worked as a mechanical planner where I was in charge with coordinating spare parts purchases with the procurement team. I also did weekly planning of maintenance activities as well as shutdowns.
